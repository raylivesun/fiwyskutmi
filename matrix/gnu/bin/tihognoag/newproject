New Project!
Have Meta Rayban glasses? (probably not... but if so, this is for you!) I've made a project that allows you to directly send images to an AI, and get back a response, all from your glasses^! This is a version 0.0.1, which means I'll be working on a full rewrite to use Playwright very soon which will improve speed, add support for voice commands, allow for better prompting, and more!

If you need help installing or using, refer to the readme first, then feel free to ask me!

^ Some message will be read as "too long" and you may need to use your phone to read the full message

** Also, this does require an OpenAI API Key, but I promise you, this project uses a few cents per day of usage, it's very much worth it (and you can usually get free credit).
